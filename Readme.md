# Challenge: Automating Tweets at Regular Intervals

The primary challenge involves tweeting at consistent intervals, such as every 30 minutes or 1 hour.

## Local Development

When using time-based loops like `30 * 60 * 60` (for 30 minutes), the system functions correctly in a local environment.

## Production Challenges

However, when deploying to a production environment or any server (e.g., Render), this approach fails. Each new deployment resets the clock, and a significant issue arises because Render does not maintain any state to keep the clock running.

## Key Learnings

To overcome this, the most effective solution is:

1. **Host the Application**: Deploy the application on a hosting platform.
2. **Create a GET API**: Develop a GET API endpoint.
3. **Trigger with Cron Jobs**: Use online cron job platforms to send a GET request to this endpoint every 30 minutes. This request triggers the code to post a tweet.

This method ensures that the tweet automation works reliably in a production environment.
